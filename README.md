    python scripts/load_dashboards.py --config configs/default_dashboard.conf
    ```

2. **Set Up Default Alerts**:

    ```bash
    python scripts/setup_alerts.py --config configs/alerts.conf
    ```

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced configurations, such as custom data inputs and complex dashboards:

1. **Edit Data Input Configurations**: Modify `configs/data_inputs.conf` to include your data sources.

2. **Customize Dashboards and Reports**: Edit `configs/dashboards.conf` and `configs/reports.conf` to tailor the dashboards and reports to your needs.

3. **Apply Advanced Settings**: Use the provided scripts to apply advanced settings:
